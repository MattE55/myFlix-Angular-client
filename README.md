## Description

Hello! I am an aspiring web developer and used this as a learning tool for Angular.

The aim of this project is to build the client-side for an application called myFlix using Angular. This application will pull from an API I created that you can also find on my github.

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to receive information on movies, directors, and genres.
- As a user, I want to be able to create a profile so I can save my favorite movies.

### Key Features

- A Welcome view where users are able to register an account or login to an existing account
- Upon authentication, display a view of all Movies
- Once on the movie view, the user can browse through information about the movie, director and genre.

### What technology did I use and why?

I chose to create the application using **Angular** due to the following considerations:

Part of the use of angular was for a learning experience. I use **Angular Material** to style the UI of my application. I enjoyed using angular because of the ease of mat cards and components. After becoming a bit familiar and finishing the application it was nice to seamlessly move through views.
